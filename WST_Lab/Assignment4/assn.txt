Create a webpage that displays a form and takes the following inputs from the user:

Input	Validation / Constraints
First Name	Minimum Length 2
Last Name	Minimum Length 2
User Name	Minimum length 4, alphanumeric, unique
Email ID	Valid email id (syntactically), unique
State	Minimum length 2
Country	Minimum length 2

To submit and reset the form create two buttons. Send the data to the PHP backend, validate,  and store it in a database. Use JavaScript for client-side 
validation of user input and show required alerts/messages to the user.    
Create another page in PHP that shows all the profiles stored on the database in the form of a list of cards.Try to reuse HTML code using PHP. 
Use seperate CSS & JavaScript files and include them using <style>, <script> tags. You are free to use any software stack such as XAMPP, WAMP, LAMP, or docker containers.
